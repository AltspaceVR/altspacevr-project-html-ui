# AltspaceVR Programming Project - Spaces Admin Web Frontend

## Instructions

Use the given data source to build an administration interface for AltspaceVR's "spaces" directory and then build some enhancements to the interface.

## Goals

We use this test to get a sense of your coding style and to how you creatively solve both a concrete problem and an abstract one. When we receive your project, here is what we will be asking ourselves:

- Does the admin interface meet the requirements?
- Is the HTML, JavaScript and CSS well structured, easy to read and understand, and organized well?
- Is the frontend implemented in a way that enables reuse and extension?
- Do the enhancements implemented work well?
- Are the enhancements creative, challenging to implement, and just plain cool?

This project should take approximately 5-15 hours to complete. To work on the project:

- Fork and clone the repo.
- Use the Promise-based data source provided in the `src/data/` folder to populate the interface.
- Your application should (and need only) be compatible with the latest version of Google Chrome.
- You may use any framework or library to help you build the interface.
- You shouldn't have to build any server-side component to complete the project.

# Part 1 - Admin interface (3-5 hours)

If you've tried AltspaceVR, you'll have seen our directory of "spaces" which users can visit and interact in. Admins can spawn new spaces and manage them in various ways. Create an interface that allows admins to view and edit spaces (their environments, titles, descriptions and user restrictions).

The interface should support typical CRUD operations for spaces, including editing its various fields, and should allow an administrator to restrict a space to a specific list of users.

# Part 2 - Enhancements (5-10 hours)

Now that you have a working admin interface, enhance it with improvements that showcase your skills and creativity. This is the open ended part of the project, and is your chance to blow us away! 

Some potential ideas:

- Make it easier to perform bulk operations (deletes, resets, etc) 
- Add a search function or a tagging function so that spaces are easier to manage and organize.
- Add a visualization the stats for the spaces (number of users, number of visits, etc)
- Anything you want! Got some new UX technique or library that you want to try? Use this as an excuse! Don't feel limited by the scope of part 1.

## Deliverable

In your repo, you should clobber this README file with your own describing your project. Any instructions or known issues should be documented in the README as well.

E-mail us a link to your Github repo to `projects@altvr.com`. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter. 

We hope you have fun working on the project, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
