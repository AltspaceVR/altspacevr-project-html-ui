# Altspace Programming Project - HTML5 UI

## Instructions

Create a small web application that demonstrates a HTML5 user interface that would be important or interesting in VR.

## Goals

We use this test to get a sense of your coding style and to how you creatively solve an abstract problem. We will be taking a look at your overall program structure, your individual coding style, and the creativity of your solution. Please design your application so that we can get a good sense of each.
This project should take approximately 5-15 hours to complete. To work on the project:

* Fork and clone the repo.
* Create a `Project` folder and build your project in there.

# Requirements

- Your application should demonstrate functionality that would be interesting if seen on a in-engine user interface or HUD in VR. 

- You may optionally render your UI over a screenshot of an environment to demonstrate what it could look like in-engine.

- If the structure of your app permits, please demonstrate some form of data binding / template rendering / MV*.

- Have a few different classes/components so we can see what code patterns and structures you use.

- Use of libraries is fine, but the more you can show us how you solve challenges the better!

- Your application should (and need only) be compatible with the latest version of Google Chrome.

## Deliverable

In your repo, you should clobber this README file with your own describing your project. Any instructions or known issues should be documented in the README as well.

E-mail us a link to your Github repo to `projects@altvr.com`. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter. 

We hope you have fun working on the project, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
